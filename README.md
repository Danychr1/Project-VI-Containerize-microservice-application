# Project-VI-Containerize-microservice-application 
    1:) About the Project
The Emart Application is a microservice-based e-commerce platform that allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and make purchases. The application consists of multiple microservices such as:

  - User Service (Handles authentication & user management)
  - Product Service (Manages product listings & inventory)
  - Cart Service (Handles shopping cart operations)
  - Order Service (Processes user orders)
  - Payment Service (Handles transactions)
    
Since the architecture is microservices-based, each service is independently developed, deployed, and scaled.
